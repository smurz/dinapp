# DINAPP

###### .net standard 1.1 sdk
[![NuGet version](https://badge.fury.io/nu/DINAPP.Libs.Client.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/nu/DINAPP.Libs.Client)

What is DINAPP?
===============
DINAPP is the monetization platform based on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows to sell digital contents from inside of your application and acquire revenue in ethereum coins. You can use this platform to sell a wide range of content, including downloadable content such as media files or photos, virtual content such as game levels or potions, premium services and features, and more.

##### Supported types of in-app purchases:
* Permanent subscription 
* Time-limited subscription
* Standard in-app products

When you use the DINAPP platform to sell an item, whether it's an in-app product or a subscription, DINAPP handles all checkout details so your application never has to directly process any ethereum transactions.

How it works?
=============
##### DINAPP smart contracts
DINAPP includes a smart contract called In-App Generator that is used to create in-app products and store info about created ones. All created In-App products are smart contracts with their own addresses on ethereum blockchain. You don't have to publish them by yourself, just send transaction to Generator and In-App purchase contract will be published with the specified parameters (name, type, price, duration, etc...) and ready to work. 

All In-App contracts have fallback functions to handle payment and getMoney function to retrieve developers revenue. Fallback functions are designed to give out one in-app purchase token at once and return the change if user sends more ethereum than required by the price.

#### DINAPP client library
Is developed targeting netstandard 1.1, hence it is compatible with all the operating systems (Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android and OSX).

###### Client library features:
1) Check the subscription status or the number of in-app products bought.
2) Access all the In-App product info.
3) Simplifies payment process with QR code and ethereum Uri scheme.
4) Allows to acquire In-App product directly with user wallet key storage and password. 
(Though it is not recommended and should be done only if you fully trust the source)

Hereby we will describe the process of creating In-App Product Contract using [Ethereum Wallet](https://github.com/ethereum/mist/releases) application.

Go to `CONTRACTS`, click `WATCH CONTRACT` and add our InAppGenerator Contract.
Copy and paste the **CONTRACT ADDRESS** of In-App Generator for your current network and the [Contract ABI of In-App Generator](/Abi/InAppGeneratorAbi.json) as **JSON INTERFACE** and name it "In-App Generator".

In-App Generator Contract addresses:
* Main Net `0xdb178152ae492bee5b4f4f5f40d1befbfdfc064b`
* Rinkeby  `0x31aaf76e08ca427eebb987c9e15d6aef0068e722`
* Ropsten  `0x703bb0c92e5839d482dbf4bc387dceef14206a98`

![WatchGeneratorContract]

Open generator contract info in the contracts watch list.

![GeneratorInfo]

Select contract function with the In-App Product type you want to create. There are 3 in-app product types: Subscription, Permanent subscription and Consumable In-App product.

![SelectGeneratorFunction]

Fill all in-app product information fields. Be careful: Set buy price in wei, not in ether. `1000000000000000000 Wei = 1 Ether`. In-App product price must be more than 1000000 Wei (1 Mwei or 0.000000000001 Ether).

![CreateSubscribtion]

Confirm and execute function.

![ExecuteCreation]

Wait until the transaction is confirmed.

![CheckTransaction]

Go back to the In-App Generator contract info, find `In app info count` and enter your wallet address. You will see the number of in-app products created for your developer wallet address.

![DevCountInApps]

Get info of the latest in-app created by entering your developer wallet address and index (for the latest created in-app product you should enter Count - 1).

![InAppInfo]

Add In-App Product token contract to Watch List. Copy and paste the contract address from the contract info and take `JSON INTERFACE` for [Subscribtion and Permanent In-App](/Abi/SubscriptionInAppAbi.json) or [Consumable In-App](/Abi/ConsumableInAppAbi.json) from this repo [Abis section](https://github.com/smurz/dinapp/tree/master/Abi).

![WatchInApp]

After that you can manage your In-App by In-Apps Functions.

![InAppFunctions]


Use the published In-App product contract address in our **DINAPP.Libs.Client** library.

### In-App purchase management:

There are 2 ways for paying for In-App product. User can send enough ether to In-App contract address directly.

![SendFunds]

Or user can execute payable function `HandlePayment` of In-App contract.

![HandlePayment]

You can give away free promo subscription or consumable to the user directly.

![Promo]

If you think that user subscription is abused you can freeze a user's subscription for some days and unfreeze it later.

![Freeze]

![Unfreeze]

Use function `GetMoney` when you want to transfer ether from In-App address to your address.

![GetMoney]

Use functions `SetDescription` and `SetPrice` to change information about In-App Purchase.

![SetDescription]

![SetPrice]

You can destroy In-App contract using function `Destruct` and transfer all accumulated funds to your account. Keep in mind that it will cancel all of the subscriptions or bought products.

![Destruct]

Create In-App Contract with Web3
===============
Get the In-App Generator contract.
Copy and paste the **CONTRACT ADDRESS** of In-App Generator for your current network and the [Contract ABI of In-App Generator](/Abi/InAppGeneratorAbi.json).

In-App Generator Contract addresses:
* Main Net `0xdb178152ae492bee5b4f4f5f40d1befbfdfc064b`
* Rinkeby  `0x31aaf76e08ca427eebb987c9e15d6aef0068e722`
* Ropsten  `0x703bb0c92e5839d482dbf4bc387dceef14206a98`

```js
var AbiOfContract = /* Paste here json abi of In-App Generator */;
var generatorAbi = web3.eth.contract(AbiOfContract);
var contractAddress = /* In-App Generator address of current Network */
var generatorContract = generatorAbi.at(contractAddress);
```
To have your In-App contracts deployed you should sign the transaction. If you have no idea on how to do this, you should read [the Web3 documentation](http://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth.html?highlight=signTransaction#signtransaction)
#### Permanent In-App
Create permanent In-App product with Web3.
```js
var buyPriceInWei = /* Price in Wei. It required to be more than 1000000 */;
var inAppName = /* In-App Product name */;
var symbol = /* ERC20 symbol of contract */;
var description = /* In-App Product description */;
var projectName = /* Project Name */;
var addressOfDeveloper = /* You will deploy In-App from this address */;
var gasAmount = /* Amount of gas to deploy contract. We recomend use ~2000000 */

generatorContract.createPermanent(buyPriceInWei, inAppName, symbol, description, projectName).send({from: addressOfDeveloper, gas: gasAmount}); 
```
#### Subscription In-App
Create subscription In-App product with Web3.
```js
var buyPriceInWei = /* Price in Wei. It should be more than 1000000 Wei */;
var amountOfDays = /* Subscription duration in days */
var inAppName = /* Name of new In-App */;
var symbol = /* ERC20 symbol of contract */;
var description = /* Description of In-App */;
var projectName = /* Name of project */;
var addressOfDeveloper = /* You will deploy In-App from this address */;
var gasAmount = /* Amount of gas for deploy contract. We recomend use ~2000000 */

generatorContract.createSubscription(buyPriceInWei, amountOfDays, inAppName, symbol, description, projectName).send({from: addressOfDeveloper, gas: gasAmount}); 
```
#### Consumable In-App
Create Consumable In-App product with Web3.
```js
var buyPriceInWei = /* Price in Wei. It should be more than 1000000 Wei */;
var inAppName = /* Name of new In-App */;
var symbol = /* ERC20 symbol of contract */;
var description = /* Description of In-App */;
var projectName = /* Name of project */;
var addressOfDeveloper = /* You will deploy In-App from this address */;
var gasAmount = /* Amount of gas for deploy contract. We recomend use ~2000000 */

generatorContract.createConsumable(buyPriceInWei, inAppName, symbol, description, projectName).send({from: addressOfDeveloper, gas: gasAmount}); 
```
Send the transaction and wait for it to confirm. You can get the address of your In-App Contract using this code.
```js
var developerAddress = /* your developer wallet address */;
generatorContract.inAppInfoCount(developerAddress); /* Get the count of your InApps products */
generatorContract.inAppInfos(developerAddress, /* Count_of_your_InApps - 1 for the latest created in-app product*/);
```
You will get all the information about InApp Product including its address. Use the published In-App product contract address in our **DINAPP.Libs.Client** library.


# DINAPP.Libs.Client integration
Take a look at [our code samples here](https://github.com/smurz/dinapp/tree/master/NetSamples) for better understanding of client library integration process with UWP app. There is also [an awsome in-app purchase dialog](https://github.com/smurz/dinapp/tree/master/NetSamples/DINAPP.Libs.Client.UWP) example there too. Feel free to just add it to your UWP app and modify its style as you wish.

#### Install and initialize
 Add DINAPP.Libs.Client reference via nuget
`Install-Package DINAPP.Libs.Client -Version 1.0.0`

Create an instance of `InAppSeviceBuilder`. It takes `EthereumNetwork` enum as parameter, choose `EthereumNetwork.MainNet` for your real-life products or one of the test networks (Rinkeby or Ropsten) for tests or debug builds. Then build an instance of `InAppService`.

``` C#
    private IInAppService _inAppService;

    var inAppServiceBuilder = new InAppSeviceBuilder(EthereumNetwork.MainNet);
    _inAppService = inAppServiceBuilder.Build();
```

#### Read in-app product info
Before you charge your user some ethereum it is recommended to show some product info.
You can get all in-app product info with `IInAppInfoReader`
```C#
    var inAppInfo = await _inAppService.InAppInfoReader
                                       .GetProductInfoAsync("<paste your in-app contract address>");
```
If your in-app product is correctly published on the selected ethereum network you will get an object with this interface as a result.
```C#
  public interface IInAppInfo
  {
    string Name { get; }
    string ProjectName { get; }
    BigInteger PriceInWei { get; }
    BigInteger DurationInDays { get; }
    uint InAppType { get; }
    string ContractAdress { get; }
    string Description { get; }
  }
```
You can also view the In-App contract publisher address and in-app product index for publisher in Generator
```C#
var publisherInfo = await _inAppService.InAppInfoReader
                                       .GetInAppRegisteredByAddressAsync("<paste your in-app contract address>");
```
#### Check in-app purchase status
In-App purchase status can be checked with `ILicenseChecker`. All status checks require User Wallet Address, that user used to buy an in-app product from. Prompt user to enter it somewhere and store it for further use.
Check Time-Limited and Permanent subscriptions status with `GetSubscriptionStatusAsync`
```C#
            var subscriptionStatus =
                await _inAppService.LicenseChecker.GetSubscriptionStatusAsync(
                    "0x... subscription in-app address",
                    "0x... user wallet address");
            if(subscriptionStatus.IsActive)
            {
                // unlock some cool features for the subscribed user
            }
```
Check the number of simple in-app products bought with `GetConsumableStatusAsync`
```C#
            var consumableStatus = await _inAppService.LicenseChecker.GetConsumableStatusAsync(
                "0x... consumable in-app address",
                "0x... user wallet address");
            var productsCount = consumableStatus.Count;
```
Ethereum blockchain has some restrictions, so we can't track how user spends your in-app consumables with our contract (otherwise he would have to pay for each transaction), so you should store the initial Count somewhere and track the change. We will have some examples on how to implement this later.

#### Payment methods
The most simple way to let user acquire **In-App product** is to show the **contract address** and its **price in Ether**. You can get both from `InAppInfoReader` as shown in example above. After that user can go to their wallet and use **In-App contract fallback** or **handlePayment** function to acquire in-app token. 

Our client library provides some methods to simplify payment process such as
* ethereum URI scheme
``` C#
var uriScheme = await _inAppService.Payment.GetPaymentUriSchemeAsync("0x... in-app address");
```
* QR code
``` C#
var qrCode = await _inAppService.Payment.GetQrCodeMatrixAsync("0x... in-app address");
```
* Direct authorized payment. (Not recommended, if you don't fully trust the source)
```C#
                //user wallet password
                var password = "";
                //read user wallet keystore .json file
                var keystore = "";

                //create new instance of KeyStorageInfo
                var keyStorageInfo = new KeyStorageInfo(password, keystore);

                //gas price = 2 Gwei. set it to what ever price is apropriate.
                var gasPrice = new BigInteger(2000000000);

                //handle payment
                //PayAuthorizedAsync method return true if payment was successfull
                var result = await _inAppService.Payment.PayAuthorizedAsync(
                                                            InAppAddress, 
                                                            UserWalletAddress, 
                                                            keyStorageInfo, 
                                                            gasPrice);

                if (result)
                {
                    //check in app purchase status
                    CheckInAppStatus();
                }
```
